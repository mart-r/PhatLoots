### Player opens a Chest  
Chests may be placed around the World by an admin and linked to specific Loot Tables. When a Player finds one of these Chests and opens it, it will randomly choose 'loot' that appears in the Chest.

### Player right clicks a Block
Any Block may function exactly like a chest as described above.

### A Dispenser is triggered by redstone
If a the dispenser is linked to a PhatLoot, the loot will be dispensed

### When a Mob (Friendly or Hostile) dies
The items/money/exp/etc. that the mob drops may be controlled by a PhatLoots loot table

Mob loot tables may be specific to the type of mob (ex. a Villiger's profession)
    
Named Mobs may have their own loot table assigned to them

### When a Mob (specifically Zombie or Skeleton) spawns
The armor and weapon that a mob spawns with may be controlled by a loot table
